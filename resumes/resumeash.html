        <li><strong>Project 1:Social Media Dashboard</strong>
          The goal of this project is to build a centralized platform that aggregates data from multiple 
          social media sites and provides insights that can improve content strategies, user engagement, and 
          overall social media presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 2:MERN Authentication</strong>  This MERN stack website offers a user-friendly
           platform built with React.js. It features secure sign-up and sign-in options, including Google 
           authentication, and allows users to update their username, email, and password with privacy protection. 
           The platform ensures safe and efficient access for users.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Project 3:Agricultural Booking System</strong>  This is a frontend project built with React.js, 
          focused on connecting farmers and contractors through a digital platform. It simplifies the booking and 
          availability of farming equipment, making it easier for small and mid-scale farmers to access essential tools. 
          The platform encourages resource sharing and helps contractors maximize the use of their machinery.

        <li><strong>Project 4: Static Portfolio website</strong>  My personal portfolio website showcases my 
          skills, projects, and experiences. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a central
           hub where visitors can learn more about me.
